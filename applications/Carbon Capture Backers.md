## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application got started during https://gitcoin.co/issue/reef-defi/reef-finance-bounties/3/100026840

Carbon Credit Backers is a IDO platform funding startups and projects that capture CO2.

### Overview

$CCB utilty tokens will help finance carbon capture entreprenuership and the CO2 sequestered by projects will provided $CCB holders with Carbon Removal Credits in exchange.

Approved carbon capture projects will be able to offer IDOs on the platform based on the potential CO2 they can sequester with their projects.

Based on the cost of their project divided by the tons of carbon credits offered will determine the amount of $CCB it cost per 1 ton carbon removal credit.

Some types of carbon removal projects cost more to preform so Carbon Capture Backers IDOs will have different yields of Carbon Removal Credits.

Using Reef Chain we plan to create cross-chain to bring more liquidity for financing carbon capture projects.
